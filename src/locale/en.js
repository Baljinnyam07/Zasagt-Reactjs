You must not use the Website if you are located in, or a citizen or resident of any state, country, territory or other jurisdiction in which use of the Website or the Digital Asset Services would be illegal or otherwise violate any applicable law (a âRestricted Territoryâ). The fact that the Website is accessible in a Restricted Territory, or that the Website allows the use of the official language of a Restricted Territory or of a language that is commonly used in a Restricted Territory, must not be construed as a license to use the Website in such a Restricted Territory.

    <li class="font-medium">Fourth. OUR SERVICES</li>
    <li>4.1. We may, at any time and in our absolute discretion, place limits or conditions on the number or type of transactions that we will enter into with you or in respect of the Account, without prior notice to you, including by (without limitation):

    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>4.2.  Use of the Digital Asset Services or otherwise conducting Digital Assetâ¯ Transactions through the Website may be subject to fees, including handling fees, network transaction fees, costs and charges, and the Companyâs fees, costs and charges. You agree to pay any such fees, costs and charges, and authorize us to apply any digital assets or fiat currencies in your Account in satisfaction thereof from time to time as those fees, costs and charges arise.</li>
    <li>4.3. We will process Digital Asset Transactions in accordance with the instructions we receive from you. You should verify all transaction information prior to submitting instructions to us. We do not guarantee the identity of any user, receiver, requestee or other party. Digital Asset Transactions cannot be reversed once they have been broadcast to the relevant Digital Asset network.</li>
    <li>4.4. Once submitted to a Digital Asset network, a Digital Asset Transaction will be unconfirmed for a period of time while pending for sufficient confirmation of the transaction by the Digital Asset network. A Digital Asset Transaction is not complete while it is in a pending state. The Digital Asset associated with the Digital Asset Transaction that is in a pending state will be designated accordingly, and will not be included in your Account balance or will not be available to conduct a Digital Asset Transaction.</li>
    <li>4.5. Our Digital Asset Services are available only in connection with those digital assets supported by ALTEX, and this may change from time to time at our sole and absolute discretion. Under no circumstances should you attempt to use your Account to store, send, request or receive digital assets in any form that we do not support (although we will use reasonable efforts to help you move or sell digital assets that we no longer support).

You acknowledge and agree that we have no responsibility whatsoever in respect of an unsupported Advanced Protocol.</li>
    <li>4.7.

    <li>4.8. Where a purchase of a Digital Asset is initiated from your Account using your credentials, we will assume that you authorized such transaction unless you notify us otherwise. It is important that you regularly check your Account balance and your transaction history and notify us in writing in case you identify any unauthorized or incorrect transactions.
