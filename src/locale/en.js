            <li>all information and documentation that you have provided to us for the purposes of engaging in digital asset trading is true, accurate and not incomplete or misleading and that if such information or documentation becomes untrue, inaccurate, incomplete or misleading for any reason whatsoever, (whether due to events under your control or not), that you will update us forthwith upon becoming aware that those details are no longer true, accurate, complete and not misleading, including the date upon which the factual correctness of the details changed;</li>
            <li>you will only trade with legally obtained digital assets or fiat currencies that belong to you, and that you have full legal and beneficial title to any such assets at the time you transfer them to us; and</li>
            <li>you are not located in, or a resident of, any Restricted Territory (as defined below), and have not used any technical means to misrepresent your geographical location to access the Website from any Restricted Territory.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>3.2. Your access to the Website and any Digital Asset Services may be restricted based upon your jurisdiction or geographical location. You must not use the Website if you are located in, or a citizen or resident of any state, country, territory or other jurisdiction in which use of the Website or the Digital Asset Services would be illegal or otherwise violate any applicable law (a “Restricted Territory”). The fact that the Website is accessible in a Restricted Territory, or that the Website allows the use of the official language of a Restricted Territory or of a language that is commonly used in a Restricted Territory, must not be construed as a license to use the Website in such a Restricted Territory. We unconditionally reserve the right to restrict access to any Restricted Territory and may implement technical controls to prevent access to the Website or any Digital Asset Services from any Restricted Territory. </li>
    <li>3.3. We may exercise our power under paragraph 10 if we detect any attempt to circumvent the restriction stated in paragraph 4.b, for example, by using a virtual private network (“VPN”), proxy or similar service that masks or manipulates the identification of your real location, or by otherwise providing false or misleading information regarding your citizenship, location or place of residence, or by using the Website through a third party or on behalf of a third party located in a Restricted Territory. </li>
    <li class="font-medium">Fourth. OUR SERVICES</li>
    <li>4.1. We may, at any time and in our absolute discretion, place limits or conditions on the number or type of transactions that we will enter into with you or in respect of the Account, without prior notice to you, including by (without limitation):
    <ul>
        <li>restrict the number, type, volume or value of transactions entered into by us on a periodic basis; </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>4.2.  Use of the Digital Asset Services or otherwise conducting Digital Asset  Transactions through the Website may be subject to fees, including handling fees, network transaction fees, costs and charges, and the Company’s fees, costs and charges. You agree to pay any such fees, costs and charges, and authorize us to apply any digital assets or fiat currencies in your Account in satisfaction thereof from time to time as those fees, costs and charges arise.</li>
    <li>4.3. We will process Digital Asset Transactions in accordance with the instructions we receive from you. You should verify all transaction information prior to submitting instructions to us. We do not guarantee the identity of any user, receiver, requestee or other party. Digital Asset Transactions cannot be reversed once they have been broadcast to the relevant Digital Asset network.</li>
    <li>4.4. Once submitted to a Digital Asset network, a Digital Asset Transaction will be unconfirmed for a period of time while pending for sufficient confirmation of the transaction by the Digital Asset network. A Digital Asset Transaction is not complete while it is in a pending state. The Digital Asset associated with the Digital Asset Transaction that is in a pending state will be designated accordingly, and will not be included in your Account balance or will not be available to conduct a Digital Asset Transaction.</li>
    <li>4.5. Our Digital Asset Services are available only in connection with those digital assets supported by ALTEX, and this may change from time to time at our sole and absolute discretion. Under no circumstances should you attempt to use your Account to store, send, request or receive digital assets in any form that we do not support (although we will use reasonable efforts to help you move or sell digital assets that we no longer support). We assume no responsibility or liability in connection with any attempt to use your Account for digital assets that we do not support.
    For the avoidance of doubt, any digital asset that: 
    - is transferred on any additional layer on top of a blockchain relating to another digital asset (or known as a “meta” layer) or any side chain; or
    - is a derivative of another digital asset , has enhanced features or functionality that supplements or interacts with another digital asset (such as a digital asset that is “colored”),  is to be treated as a distinct digital asset from such other digital asset  and its use in connection with the Digital Asset Services will be at ALTEX’s sole and absolute discretion.</li>
